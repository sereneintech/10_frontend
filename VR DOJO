In terms of coding, we took an incredibly coollaborative approach

	- alternate on html semantics and structure - 10 min time blocks, where we shared screens and resolved roadblacks for each other either via prior exp or Google research 

	- communicate openly, challenging ech others appraoch and decided on best way forward; comm with messenger group while we are not on a synchronous call

	- split on css format and styling for each section
		e.g. Rebecca on nav bar, Rimm on design, Ilya worked on products, I worked on testimonials, Xingchen on footer

- time deadlines + documented good code snippets

Finally, following the process of an Agile sprint, we carried out RETROSPECTIVES - where we evaluate and provide feedback for improvements to further render out website.
